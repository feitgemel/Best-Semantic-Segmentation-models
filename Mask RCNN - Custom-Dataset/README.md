🎯 Train a Custom Mask R-CNN for Lung Segmentation (Step-by-Step)
In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to train your own Mask R-CNN model for lung segmentation using a custom medical dataset—all in PyTorch! 

We’ll go from raw images and masks to a trained deep learning model that predicts lung regions from chest scans.

🔥 Whether you’re into medical imaging, deep learning, or just want to build your own AI from scratch, this is the full pipeline you’ve been looking for.
<br/><br/> 
🔹 What you’ll learn:

- How to preprocess a medical image dataset with masks
- How to train Mask R-CNN with transfer learning using ResNet-50
- How to use PyTorch's built-in models from torchvision
- DHow to run inference and visualize segmentation masks
- How to save and load models for production use
