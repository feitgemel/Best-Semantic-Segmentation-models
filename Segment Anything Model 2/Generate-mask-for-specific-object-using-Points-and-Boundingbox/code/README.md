🎯 Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) + Python = next-level image segmentation!

In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to interactively segment images using the powerful SAM2 model from Meta, with support for point clicks, bounding boxes, and automated mask generation.

<br/><br/> 
🔹 What you’ll learn:

- Load and visualize images with OpenCV
- Select points interactively with your mouse
- Guide SAM2 using points, boxes, or both
- Generate high-quality masks with just a few prompts
- Visualize your results using Supervision’s beautiful annotations
