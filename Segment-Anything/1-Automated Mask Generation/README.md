The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a powerful tool for automated mask generation, enabling users to effortlessly segment and extract objects from images through its advanced instance segmentation capabilities.

Image segmentation tasks can be streamlined with Segment Anything, a cutting-edge model that generates accurate masks for any object or region within an image, facilitating efficient object extraction and analysis.

<br/><br/> 
In this tutorial we will cover a simple way to segment masks out of an image automatically.

We will install the relevant Python libraries ,  and write the Python script for this task .
