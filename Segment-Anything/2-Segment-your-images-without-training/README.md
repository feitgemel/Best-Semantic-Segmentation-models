Segment Anything: Achieve custom image segmentation effortlessly, no training required.

Image segmentation tasks can be streamlined with Segment Anything, a cutting-edge model that generates accurate masks for any object or region within an image, facilitating efficient object extraction and analysis.

<br/><br/> 
In this tutorial we will use your own custom images , and learn how to grabs and tune the mask generation out of those images . 

We will install the relevant Python libraries ,  and write the Python script for this task .

<br/><br/>
