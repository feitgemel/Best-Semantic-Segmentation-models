Build Custom Image Segmentation Model Using YOLOv8 and SAM

Learn How to build your custom Image Segmentation model using Segment Anything Model (SAM).
SAM is a promptable segmentation system with zero-shot generalization to unfamiliar objects and images, without the need for additional training.

This model can help us perform segmentation task very easily.
They built the largest segmentation dataset with over 1 billion masks on 11M images.
<br/><br/> 
In this tutorial we will learn how to use YoloV8 to detect an object , and we will use the coordinates as an augment for image segmentation using Segment Anything 

We will install the relevant Python libraries ,  and write the Python script for this task .
