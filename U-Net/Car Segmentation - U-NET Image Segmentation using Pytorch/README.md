🚨 Before You Train a U-Net… Watch This car segmentation tutorial 🚨  

If you're planning to build a U-Net model for image segmentation, STOP — and watch this first.
In this step-by-step Python tutorial, I walk you through a complete U-Net project, from dataset preparation to training and testing, using PyTorch.
You'll learn how to:

<br/><br/> 
🔹 What you’ll learn:

- How to build a U-Net model from scratch
- How to train your model on the Carvana segmentation challenge 
- How to run inference on single image
- How to run inference on multiple test images
<br/><br/>
