In this hands-on tutorial I (Eran) walk you through my complete U²-Net pipeline: from loading the dataset and training a U²-Net-Lite in TensorFlow, all the way to instant background removal on your own images. 
No blurry edges, no green screen, just pure code magic.

You'll learn how to:

<br/><br/> 
🔹 What you’ll learn:

- How to build a U2-Net model 
- Pre-processing the dataset into a pipeline
- How to train your model on the persons segmentation dataset 
- How to run inference on a single test image
<br/><br/>
