🚨 Before You Train a U-Net… Watch This car segmentation tutorial 🚨  

In this full-stack tutorial I guide you through building a VGG16-U-Net that segments satellite images into *storm* vs *background*—all in pure Python with TensorFlow 2.

In this hands-on session we build, train, and deploy an Unet VGG16 in TensorFlow that separates storm plumes from background terrain

You'll learn how to:

<br/><br/> 
🔹 What you’ll learn:

- How to build a U-Net VGG16 model from scratch
- Pre-processing the dataset into a pipeline
- How to train your model on the Dust storm segmentation dataset 
- How to run inference on a single test image
<br/><br/>
