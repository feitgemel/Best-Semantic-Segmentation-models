Train and Test YOLOv11 for Fiber Image Segmentation in Python!
In this tutorial, I’ll walk you step-by-step through training YOLOv11 on a fiber segmentation dataset and running inference on test images — all using Python, Ultralytics, OpenCV, and NumPy.

Whether you're working on defect detection, material analysis, or simply want to master semantic segmentation, this video gives you a real-world use case with practical code.


<br/><br/> 
🔹 What you’ll learn:

- How to prepare your data for the Yolo format ?
- How to build and train YOLOv11 model on a custom fiber dataset
- How to run inference on new images
- How to extract, visualize, and save predicted masks
- How to compare predicted vs. true masks using OpenCV
