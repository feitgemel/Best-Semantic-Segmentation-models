In this tutorial, you'll learn how to segment different objects inside a single image using the powerful YOLO V11 model and Python!
We’ll walk through the complete process: loading the YOLO V11 segmentation model, predicting object masks, drawing colorful polygons around detected objects, and saving the final segmented image.

<br/><br/> 
🔹 What you’ll learn:

- How to load the YOLO V11 segmentation model
- How to predict segmentation masks on an image
- How to extract masks and polygons
- How to visualize segmentation masks with Pillow (PIL)
- How to draw and color polygons around different objects
