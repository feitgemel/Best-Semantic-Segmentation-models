In this hands-on tutorial, I’ll walk you through **real-time object segmentation and tracking using YOLOv11 and Python** — from loading the model to drawing colorful masks and saving the output video.

We’ll process a video of dogs running through snow, assign each one a unique tracking ID, and overlay segmentations with smooth live updates. 

Whether you’re a beginner or pro, you’ll learn how to bring segmentation to life with powerful tools like Ultralytics, Opencv2, and real-time video processing.

<br/><br/> 
🔹 What you’ll learn:

- How to load a YOLOv11 segmentation model in Python
- How to track multiple objects in real time
- How to visualize masks and track IDs dynamically
- How to process and save annotated video output
<br/><br/>
