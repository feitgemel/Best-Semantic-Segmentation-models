Want to make your dog the star of any video? In this video, we'll show you how to use the power of YOLOv8 and Python to segment dogs in images and videos!

This video unlocks the secrets of YOLOv8, a cutting-edge AI model, to segment dogs in images and videos with Python.

We'll take you on a step-by-step journey:

1. Training YOLOv8:  train your own AI to recognize your dog.

2. Isolating Your Dog : Learn how to use your pre-trained YOLOv8 to magically separate your dog from any background.

3. Merge Effects: Replace the background with any scene you can dream of - beaches, mountains, even outer space!
