The class index (0-based)
The normalized coordinates of the bounding box (x_center, y_center, width, height) where:
x_center, y_center are the coordinates of the center of the bounding box relative to the width and height of the image
width, height are the width and height of the bounding box relative to the width and height of the image
For example:

The first line indicates an object of class 0 (e.g., "person") 
with a bounding box whose center is located at approximately (50.03%, 41.48%) of the image width 
and height, and has a width of approximately 23.56% and a height of approximately 58.98% of 
the image width and height.

The second line indicates an object of class 1 (e.g., "car") with a bounding box whose center is located 
at approximately (75.47%, 36.57%) of the image width and height, 
and has a width of approximately 11.88% and a height of approximately 28.15% of 
the image width and height.
